* SAMPLE: Motivation
- Produce Level 1b AIRS,CrIS, IASI and CHIRP radiances for trending and retrievals.
- Goals
   - Radiometric stability, inter-sensor bias, intra-sampling bias and trending analysis.
\vspace{0.05in}

Working in radiance space is in principle very simple and quick.  Allows frequent re-processing. 

\vspace{0.05in}

What's Hard: 
  - Dealing with clouds
  - AIRS radiometric stability estimates (ie. how good?)

* Outline of talk
  - Historical Context
  - Design Features
  - Strengths
  - Limitations
  - Applications examples
  - Current Needs, Future Developments

* Historical Context

  - The SARTA was developed on 1990s computer systems - light load and memory requirements.
  - Origninaly developed as part of AIRS level 2 retrieval suite.
  - First supplied to AIRS project with separate coefficient sets for different instrument focal
    plane and filter temperatures.
  - Since 2016 SARTA was delivered for the AIRS.L1C channel SRF specification.
  - Used for AIRS validation and more recently for CrIS and IASI validation.
  - In the past couple of years has been adapted for use with CHIRP.


* Attributes: Strengths
  - Implicitly high speed computation (even more on modern systems).
  - SARTA is available for clear-sky and all-sky (scattering) computations.
  - Flexible channel selection, multi-sensor compatible, relatively quick development/update turn-around.
  - The scattering version uses a fast 2-slab model for clouds and aerosols (S. De Souza-Machado).
  - Model includes H2O, CO2, O3, N2O, CO, CH4, HNO3, HDO, SO2, NH3, nonLTE (4.3 um), Surface emissivity
    and albedo, scattering from water, ice, aerosols, smoke.  Other absorbers could be added.
  - Accuracy well quantified.

* Attributes: Dependencies
  - Fast coefficients are derived using Optical Depths calculated using kCARTA - the pseudo-line by line
    RTA (S. De Souza-Machado)
  - The atmospheric layering is currently defined as the 101 AIRS levels set, using Klayers algorithm.
  - The atmospheric layering can be changed (see later).
  - The data format for file I/O uses the HDF4 specification (original to AIRS project) (see later).
  - The spectral line shapes use the HITRAN databases, cross-sections and various dust and aerosol models.
  - Code is written in FORTRAN (this is NOT a limitation!).
  - Radiometric accuracy may be improved with tuning in some regions.

* Attributes: Limitations
  - Finite diff Jacs - until now !
  - HDF4 dependency. 

* Most Recent updates
- HITRAN 2020 spectroscopy (actual data available early 2022).
- HDO included.
- New nonLTE model being tested.


* Updates 1: HITRAN 2020 vs 2016
- Most significant change in 1050 cm-1 O3 band.

* Updates 2: HDO included

* Updates 3: nonLTE

* Beneficial Future Changes
- Make independent (agnostic) of file format types (HDF4, H5, netCDF).
- Simplify packaging and coefficient management.
- Extend/update training set, add machine learning if demonstrably beneficial.
- Adapt to the cloud and complete open-source migration (documentation).
- Re-package code with Julia or Python wrappers for wider community use.
- Include as part of CHIRP processing suite (cloud).

* Future 1: File format, Coefficient packaging

* Future 2: Adapt to Cloud
